When it comes to learning a new framework or language, the first thing that comes to our mind is creating a Todo app that has all the basic CRUD functionalities. So in this article, we will create a Todo CRUD RESTful API in a Deno environment that runs on an Oak middleware server and uses a MongoDB database.

### Topics Covered

- What is Deno Oak Middleware Framework?
- Installing Deno
- Setup Oak Middleware and Routing
- Setup MongoDB Server with Docker
- Connect Deno to MongoDB Server
- Create the MongoDB Database Models
- Create the Request Validation Schemas
- Create the Route Controllers
    - Add the Dependency Imports
    - Create Document Controller
    - Update Document Controller
    - Read a Single Document Controller
    - Read All Documents Controller
    - Delete Document Controller
    - Export the Controllers
- Create/Merge the API Routes with Oak
- Test the Deno API with Postman
    - Create a new document
    - Update an existing document
    - Get a single document
    - Get all the documents
    - Delete a document

## 3.  Authentication with Bcrypt, JWT, and Cookies in Deno

![ Authentication with Bcrypt, JWT, and Cookies in Deno](https://codevoweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Authentication-with-Bcrypt-JWT-and-Cookies-in-Deno.webp)

To demonstrate how JWT authentication works in Deno, we'll build an API that runs on an Oak middleware server and uses a MongoDB database. Then, we'll add an authentication guard where only users with a valid JSON Web Token will be able to access the protected routes. Also, we'll make the passwords secure by hashing them with the Bcrypt library.

### Topics Covered

- Setup the API Project
- Create the Database Model with MongoDB
- Create the Validation Schemas with Zod
- Load the Environment Variables in Deno
- Create Utility Functions
    - Function to Sign and Verify the JSON Web Token
    - Function to Hash and Verify the Passwords
    - Function to Omit Fields from an Object
- Create the API Route Controllers
    - Register User Controller
    - Login User Controller
    - Logout User Controller
    - Request Authenticated User's Profile Controller
- Create the Middleware Guard
- Create the API Routes
- Add the Routes to the Deno Application

## 4. Build a Complete Deno CRUD RESTful API with MongoDB

![Build a Complete Deno CRUD RESTful API with MongoDB](https://codevoweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Build-a-Complete-Deno-CRUD-RESTful-API-with-MongoDB.webp)

In this tutorial, we'll cover how to build a Deno API that supports CRUD operations and stores data in a MongoDB database. The example API will run on an Oak middleware framework that will include routes to create, retrieve, update, and delete documents in the database.

### Topics Covered

- Run the Deno + MongoDB CRUD API Locally
- Setup the Deno CRUD API
- Create the MongoDB Model
- Create the Validation Schemas with Zod
- Create the Oak Middleware Route Handlers
    - Add document handler
    - Update document handler
    - Get a single document handler
    - Get all documents handler
    - Delete a document handler
- Create the Oak Middleware Routes
- Register the API Routes
